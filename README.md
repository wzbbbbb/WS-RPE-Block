# WS-RPE-Block
WS-RPE Block: FPGA Architecture for Real-Time Eigenvalue Computation in Edge Control Systems Journal Submission: IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (TVLSI) Systems


Overview
WS-RPE Block is an innovative hardware architecture designed for real-time eigenvalue computation in edge Physics-AI systems. The architecture implements dynamic scheduling mechanisms to efficiently handle the small, sparse, and evolving matrices typical of control system stability monitoring.

The core innovation lies in the co-design of work-stealing and redundant-PE activation as first-class hardware primitives, enabling adaptive computation that matches the dynamic nature of control system workloads.

🏗️ Architecture Overview
Core Components
The architecture consists of several key modules that work together to provide dynamic, adaptive computation:

Dynamic Work-Stealing Controller: Redistributes tasks from overloaded to idle pipelines

Redundant-PE Mapper: Activates secondary computation paths during congestion

Block Partitioner: Adaptively partitions matrices into optimal sub-blocks

Reorder Buffer: Manages out-of-order computation results

Dynamic Adjustment Unit: Adapts convergence parameters based on workload patterns

Key Features
Multi-Size Block Parallelism: Supports 2×2 to N×N block decomposition

Cross-Queue Task Redistribution: Hardware-implemented work stealing

On-Demand Redundancy: Dual-path execution for congested pipelines

Adaptive Convergence: Dynamic threshold adjustment using temporal correlation

Standard Interfaces: AXI-Stream for easy system integration
